In the 'Question Figure' section, there are three stages of folding and one stage of cutting:
1. The first image shows a square piece of paper with a diagonal fold from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, indicated by an arrow pointing from the top left to the bottom right.
2. The second image shows the paper folded again along the same diagonal, resulting in a smaller triangle. This is indicated by two arrows pointing towards the center of the triangle.
3. The third image shows the paper folded into an even smaller triangle, indicated by another arrow pointing towards the center.
4. The fourth image shows the smallest triangle with a single dot cut out from the center, indicated by a small circle.

In the 'Answer Figure' section, there are four possible outcomes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, showing how the paper might look when unfolded:
1. The first option shows a square with four dots arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern.
2. The second option shows a square with four dots arranged in a diamond pattern.
3. The third option shows a square with four dots arranged in a square pattern, with one dot in each corner.
4. The fourth option shows a square with four dots arranged in a cross pattern, with one dot in the center and one dot in the middle of each side.

The task is to determine which of the four options correctly represents the appearance of the paper when it is unfolded after being folded and cut as shown in the 'Question Figure' section.",D
