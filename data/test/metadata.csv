The triangle overlaps with the square at the bottom right corner. The point of interest is located at the intersection of all three shapes.The answer figures are as follows:1. Figure (1) has a circle at the bottom left, a triangle at the top right, and a square at the top left. The circle overlaps with both the triangle and the square. The triangle overlaps with the square at the top right corner.2. Figure (2) has a circle at the bottom right, a triangle at the top right, and a square at the top left. The circle overlaps with both the triangle and the square. The triangle overlaps with the square at the top right corner.3. Figure (3) has a circle at the bottom right, a triangle at the bottom left, and a square at the top left. The circle overlaps with both the triangle and the square. The triangle overlaps with the square at the bottom left corner.4. Figure (4) has a circle at the bottom right, a triangle at the bottom right, and a square at the top left. The circle overlaps with both the triangle and the square. The triangle overlaps with the square at the bottom right corner.",1

Answer figure (1) is a square divided into several smaller sections by intersecting lines. There are two diagonal lines forming an 'X' shape, and two horizontal and two vertical lines dividing the square into smaller rectangles and triangles.

Answer figure (2) is a square divided into smaller sections by horizontal and vertical lines. There are three horizontal lines and three vertical lines, creating a grid of smaller rectangles and squares within the larger square.

Answer figure (3) is a square containing a large triangle pointing upwards, similar to the question figure. Inside this large triangle, there are several smaller triangles formed by intersecting lines.

Answer figure (4) is a square containing a circle at the center. Inside the circle, there is a smaller triangle pointing upwards. The circle is intersected by a vertical line that extends from the top to the bottom of the square.",3
