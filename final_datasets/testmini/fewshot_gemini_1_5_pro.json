Expanding this expression, we get 2 + 6 * 2^(2/3) + 6 * 2^(1/3) + 12 + 12 * 2^(1/3) + 12 * 2^(2/3) + 6 * 2^(1/3) + 6 * 2^(2/3) = 14 + 24 * 2^(1/3) + 24 * 2^(2/3). Now, notice that 14 + 24 * 2^(1/3) + 24 * 2^(2/3) = 14 + 24(2^(1/3) + 2^(2/3)). Since x = 2^(1/3) + 2^(2/3), we can simplify this expression to 14 + 24x.  Therefore, x^3 + 6x^2 + 6x = 14 + 24x. Since x is given to be 2^(1/3) + 2^(2/3), we can substitute this back into the equation to find the final result.  This gives us 14 + 24(2^(1/3) + 2^(2/3)) = 14 + 24 * 2^(1/3) + 24 * 2^(2/3).
