The objective is to determine which of these statements is/are true.\",\n\"Q3\": \"Step 1: Analyze statement 1 - 'In a triangle ABC, angle A = x\u00b0, angle B = 3x\u00b0, and angle C = 2x\u00b0, then it is an equilateral triangle.' For a triangle to be equilateral, all three angles must be equal to 60\u00b0. Substituting x = 60 in the given angles, we get A = 60\u00b0, B = 180\u00b0, and C = 120\u00b0, which is not possible in a triangle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStep 2: Analyze statement 2 - 'If the product of two whole numbers is 21 and their difference is 4, then the ratio of the numbers is 2:3.' Let the two numbers be x and y. Then, x * y = 21 and x - y = 4. Solving these equations, we get x = 7 and y = 3. The ratio of 7:3 is 7/3 = 2.33, which can be simplified to 2:3. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze statement 3 - 'The distance between the points O(0, 0) and A(2, 3) is 5 units.' Using the distance formula in coordinate geometry, the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by \u221a[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Substituting the given coordinates, we get \u221a[(2 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2] = \u221a(4 + 9) = \u221a13, which is not equal to 5. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStep 4: Analyze statement 4 - 'If (Cos^2\u03b8 - 3)/(1 - Sin\u03b8 - 2) = 0, then \u03b8 = 30\u00b0. (0\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 90\u00b0)' Simplifying the given expression, we get (Cos^2\u03b8 - 3)/(1 - Sin\u03b8 - 2) = (Cos^2\u03b8 - 3)/(Cos\u03b8) = 0. This implies that either Cos^2\u03b8 - 3 = 0 or Cos\u03b8 = 0. Solving for \u03b8, we get Cos^2\u03b8 - 3 = 0 when \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 or 150\u00b0, and Cos\u03b8 = 0 when \u03b8 = 90\u00b0. However, the condition 0\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 90\u00b0 eliminates the solutions \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 150\u00b0.
