From the given equation, x + y + z = 0, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. Let's express z from the given equation:   z = - (x + y).2. Substituting z in the expression x^2/(yz) + y^2/(xz) + z^2/(xy):   x^2/(y(-x-y)) + y^2/(x(-x-y)) + (-x-y)^2/(xy).3. Simplifying the denominators:   y(-x-y) = -yx - y^2.   x(-x-y) = -x^2 - xy.   4.

The information given is:  4 play cricket and hockey, 5 play cricket and football, 10 play hockey and football, 4 play cricket only, 8 play hockey only, and 5 play football only. To determine the total number of students playing cricket, hockey, or football, we need to add up all these categories while accounting for overlap: 4 (cricket and hockey) + 5 (cricket and football) + 10 (hockey and football) + 4 (only cricket) + 8 (only hockey) + 5 (only football). This total comes to 36. However, it should be noted that some students have been counted multiple times because they belong to multiple categories. To resolve this, we must adjust for the overlaps. When we do this correctly,  we find that all players effectively make up 28 unique individuals.
