The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the 5th term of the sequence is 5 and the sum of the first 5 terms is 55. We can use these two pieces of information to solve for the first term and the common difference.\n\nLet's start by finding the common difference. We know that the 5th term is 5, so we can plug this into the formula:\n\n5 = a_1 + (5-1)d\n5 = a_1 + 4d\nd = (5 - a_1) / 4\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the first 5 terms is 55 to solve for the first term:\n\nSum of first 5 terms = a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 3d) + (a_1 + 4d)\n55 = 5a_1 + 10d\n55 = 5a_1 + 10(5 - a_1) / 4\n55 = 5a_1 + 50 - 10a_1 / 4\n55 = -5a_1 / 4 + 50\na_1 = 15\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is 15.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"B\",\n  \"Q5\": \"B\"\n}",
