For example, given the relationship between a and b, determining the equivalent of b to c. Questions involving substituting characters and operations in a pre-defined pattern fall into this category.\nsequence_completion: given a sequence of numbers or figures, this question involves finding the sequentially next element in a series.\nfigure_completion: You are given a figure with an arrangement of numbers or characters such that their relationship to one another based on their position in the figure is consistent.
